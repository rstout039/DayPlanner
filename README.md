# DayPlanner
For this activity I created a day planner to schedule events.
When you open the planner the date is dispayed at the top.
When you scroll down you are presented with timeblocks for various times in the day.
The timeblocks will be color coated to indicate past, present, and future events. 
When you click on a timeblock you can enter an event. 
When you click on the save button that event will be stored into local storage.
That event will then be saved and displayed into the calendar/planner and will appear when you refresh the page.
